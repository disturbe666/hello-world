Hello everyone im very new to this so i have no idea about what different kinds of coding there are.
But i need to know what kind this is, GD_Weap_AssaultRifle.Name.Title.Title_Rifle so please don't be too harsh lol.
i wanna learn how to write that code so i can write a program and input the coding into a certain engine i have for my favorite game!
So with that all squared away if you all could be patient and help me when I need it that would mean the world to me.
Thank you very much!
